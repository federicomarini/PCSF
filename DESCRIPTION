Description: The PCSF package performs an integrated analysis of highthroughput 
    data using the interaction networks as a template, and interprets the biological 
    landscape of interaction networks with respect to the data, which potentially 
    leads to predictions of functional units. It also interactively visualize the 
    resulting subnetwork with functional enrichment analysis. TODO Add one sentence.
